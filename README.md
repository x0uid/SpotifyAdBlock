I will show you how to easily block the servers hosting Spotify ads on your Linux/Mac or Windows machine. 
This will allow you to listen all day long on a free account without hearing a single ad or being tracked by third party. This trick is very simple, legal and works great.

In order to remove those pesky ads, all we need to do is setup out hosts file to override the DNS for Spotify's ad servers and redirect that traffic to our local machine.  

When the traffic hits out local machine the call will fail and the tracking third party advertising will be skipped.

Download & open [**hosts**](https://github.com/x0uid/SpotifyAdBlock/blob/master/hosts) file using your favorite text editor. 

**For Windows 10 & 8:**

*Press the Windows key.*
*Type Notepad in the search field.*
*In the search results, right-click Notepad and select Run as administrator.*
*From Notepad, open the following file: c:\Windows\System32\Drivers\etc\hosts*
*Make the necessary changes to the file. Click File > Save to save your changes.*

**For Linux:**

*Open a terminal window.*
*Open the hosts file in a text editor (you can use any text editor) by typing the following line:*

*sudo nano /etc/hosts*

**For Mac OS X 10.6 through 10.12:**

*Open Applications > Utilities > Terminal.*
*Open the hosts file by typing the following line in the terminal window:*

*sudo nano /private/etc/hosts*

*Type your domain user password when prompted.*
*Edit the hosts file.The file contains some comments (lines starting with the # symbol), and some default hostname mappings* (for example, 127.0.0.1 – local host). Add your new mappings after the default mappings.*
*Save the hosts file by pressing Control+x and answering y.*
*Make your changes take effect by flushing the DNS cache with the following command:*

*dscacheutil -flushcache*

*There you go, editing hosts file has taken effect.*

It is advisable to clear Spotify cache afterwards in order for the changes to take effect.
